# Wish App

Wish API for building services and applications

* Enables direct access to all core functionality
* Supports registering multiple protocols
* Keeps track of peers of each protocol

```js
/**
 * Minimalistic Chat for Wish
 * 
 * Run two clients with different WSIDs.
 *   WSID=chat1 node chat.js
 */

var App = require('wish-app').Service;

var app = new App({name: 'Chat CLI', wsid: process.env.WSID, protocols: [{name: 'chat'}]});

var chat = app.registerProtocol('chat');

chat.on('online', function(peer) {
    console.log("("+ peer.r +"@"+ peer.rhid +"/"+ peer.rsid +" entered)");
});

chat.on('offline', function(peer) {
    console.log("("+ peer.r +"@"+ peer.rhid +"/"+ peer.rsid +" left)");
});

chat.on('frame', function(data, peer) {
    var pattern = /\x1B\[([ABCD])/gm; // dump control characters
    console.log(peer.r+" says: ", data.toString().replace(pattern, "")); //, "("+peer.l+", "+peer.rhid+"/"+peer.rsid+")");
});

process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');

process.stdin.on('data', function(data) {
    var msg = new Buffer(data.trim());
    chat.broadcast(msg);
});
```

## Understanding Wish and its distributed model

The well known client-server model of writing applications is not sufficient to write distributed applications. There are some parallels but one should understand the fundamental differances imposed by the distributed model.

### Getting started in practice

A few simple steps are required to work with examples or to start developing own applications on Wish. You need at least one Wish Core, and a
